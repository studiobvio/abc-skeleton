      The Academia Working Group of The Architecture Lobby ran a Summer 2022
      workshop as part of its annual Architecture Beyond Capitalism (ABC)
      School. The ABC 2022 workshop built on the 2021 session, which focused on
      Capitalism, Labor, and Collectives, by concentrating on studio educational
      practices. As the pedagogical setting in which most of an architecture
      student’s and teacher’s time and resources are focused, studio was
      explored as a key site in which to test how organizing and action for
      change can become foundational in architectural practice and posit other
      roles for the architect beyond the ‘designer.’ As a beginning prompt, the
      ABC asked: how do we understand studio to support and encourage activist
      organization? How might design be taught in ways that do not perpetuate
      and reproduce capitalist exploitation? We coordinated a workshop to call
      forth action-based approaches to changing architecture education by
      bringing together students, educators, practitioners, constructors –
      anyone interested in rethinking the architectural studio across different
      settings and scales. This workshop acted as an open platform to build a
      cohort committed to the present and future work necessary for change in
      “design” education/practice. Any person who is reconsidering or wants to
      reconsider what studio means and how it can create relevant architectural
      workers with the skills to instigate, organize, and work for change, was
      encouraged to participate in, contribute to, or lead these virtual
      conversations.
